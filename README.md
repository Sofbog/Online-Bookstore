# Online-Bookstore
Related entities:
Book: A book available for purchase in the online bookstore.
Customer: A customer who can browse and purchase books from the online bookstore.

Application Overview:
The Flask application will allow customers to browse and purchase books from the online bookstore. The application will maintain two database tables: books and customers. The books table will store information about the available books, including the book title, author, description, and price. The customers table will store information about the customers who purchase books, including the customer's name, email, and purchase history.

Technology Stack:
The application will be developed using the following technologies:

Python
Flask
SQLAlchemy
MySQL
Database Tables:
The books table will have the following columns:

id: The unique ID of the book.
title: The title of the book.
author: The author of the book.
description: A brief description of the book.
price: The price of the book.
The customers table will have the following columns:

id: The unique ID of the customer.
name: The name of the customer.
email: The email address of the customer.
purchase_history: A JSON-encoded string representing the customer's purchase history. The purchase history will be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a purchase and includes the book ID, title, and price.
Flask Application Routes:
The following Flask routes will be implemented:

GET /books: Return a list of all available books.
GET /books/<int:book_id>: Return the details of a specific book.
POST /customers: Create a new customer.
GET /customers/<int:customer_id>: Return the details of a specific customer.
POST /customers/<int:customer_id>/purchase: Allow a customer to purchase a book.
Conclusion:
This simple Flask application provides the basic functionality of an online bookstore, allowing customers to browse and purchase books. The application uses two database tables to store information about the available books and customers, and provides a simple RESTful API for interacting with the data. The MySQL database can be configured using the appropriate driver and connection string in the Flask application.
